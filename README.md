## About

A zero-install instant JPEG/PNG viewer for Windows,
supporting random jumps and image sorting into sub folders.

Loads all images from a folder, including all sub folders.
Sorts them by modification time, and shows the most recent one.
Walk back through images by 'a' or cursor left.
Walk forward through images by 'd' or cursor right.
Press '1' for a random jump.

Easy C++ source code, zero dependencies, compiled with a single command.
Ideal for cloning and extending.

Right now this repo is a basic stub, 
to provide the source code for direct use from GitHub.
